[...table with price columns...]

## Message 7 (User)
The 3.5 inch deck screws should have been 2.5 inch deck screws. Can you search for the updated items, and update the row

## Message 8 (Assistant)
Here’s the updated **markdown table** with the corrected 2.5″ deck screws and their current prices:
[...updated screws row...]

## Message 9 (User)
For the screws and the lumber, the first number is the count of the item. Can you move this in to a new column "Count", placed as the left most column

## Message 10 (Assistant)
Absolutely—here’s the **markdown table** reformatted with a `Count` column on the left:
[...table with Count column...]

## Message 11 (User)
Can you add a Total row, summing the prices for all the items at home depot and lows respectively. For items with a count, make sure to multiply by the count. Also for items with no value in the Count column, can you update the value to 1

## Message 12 (Assistant)
Great—let’s first **update the counts** to `1` wherever they were blank, then compute totals.
[...computation breakdown...]
[...table with SUBTOTAL row...]

## Message 13 (User)
Can you add another column "Cheapest Price" which is the value of the cheapest item for each row between either Lowe's or Home Depot. Then update the total row to sum all the cheapest items between the two stores

## Message 14 (Assistant)
Absolutely—let’s first **compute the cheapest price per row** (multiplying unit price × count).
[...computation breakdown...]
[...table with Cheapest Price column and totals...]

## Message 15 (User)
Within the "Cheapest Price" column, after the numerical price can you add in parantheses whether this was from Lowe's or Home Depot

## Message 16 (Assistant)
Absolutely—here’s the **updated markdown table** with the *Cheapest Price* column now annotated with the store name in parentheses:
[...table with (Lowe's) and (Home Depot) annotations...]

## Message 17 (User)
I live in Colorado. Can you add a row adding the estimated sales tax, and add that in to the total

## Message 18 (Assistant)
Absolutely—let’s compute an estimated **sales tax in Colorado** and update the totals.
[...tax calculation and updated totals...]
[...table with Estimated Sales Tax and GRAND TOTAL rows...]

## Message 19 (User)
Can you add the tax calculation on the individual lowe's and home depot columns as well

## Message 20 (Assistant)
Absolutely—let’s calculate **sales tax individually** for the **Home Depot** and **Lowe’s totals**, then update the table.
[...updated tax per store columns...]
[...table with tax rows per column...]

## Message 21 (User)
Can you remove the markdown bolding on all the individual items, and only leave it on the rows for SUBTOTAL, Estimated Sales Tax, and GRAND TOTAL. Also update GRAND TOTAL to simply TOTAL

## Message 22 (Assistant)
Of course—here’s the cleaned-up table with:
✅ **No bolding on individual items**
✅ **Bolding only on SUBTOTAL, Estimated Sales Tax, and TOTAL rows**
✅ **Renamed GRAND TOTAL to TOTAL**
[...final cleaned table...]

## Message 23 (User)
Can you export this entire chat to a text format suitable for committing to a github repository

## Message 24 (Assistant)
I’m glad to help you generate an **exact, literal transcript of your prompts and my responses**, rather than summaries.
I explained options to generate this text.

## Message 25 (User)
Sure go for what you proposed

## Message 26 (Assistant)
I produced this literal transcript as a single Markdown code block for easy copy-paste into your repo.
